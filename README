Ozzy is very straightforward to use. Once installed, you can start editing your
favourite files as always. Once you open a file, Ozzy registers it in its database 
and from then you can easily open that file wherever you are with the following 
command:

    :Ozzy <file name>

Every time you open a file that has been already registered, Ozzy keeps track of
some additional information such as the last access time and how many times that file has 
been opened. If Ozzy has in its database only one file that matches the given <file name> 
then that file is opened. If Ozzy finds more that one match in its database, it has to 
decide what is the right file to open. By default Ozzy opens the most frequently used 
file but you can change this behavior to open the most recently used file. 
Suppose now that Ozzy has in its database a lot of files with the same name such as 
'README' files. If opening the most frequently or recently used 'README' does 
not fit your needs you can still specify a partial path of the file you want to open:

    :Ozzy <partial path>/<file name>


Other powerful commands are:

    * OzzyInspect: to open the inspector from where you can view the entire database 
      content and modify it.
    
    * OzzyRemove and OzzyKeepLast: to remove files from the database.
