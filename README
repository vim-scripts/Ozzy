Open your files from wherever you are. If you have edited a file at least once
you can open that file using just its name.

Commands
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ozzy

This is the most important command. Use this command and a small window will 
popup at the bottom of the Vim window with a special command line. Start typing 
the file you want to open and you'll see the list updating as you type. Below there
is list of all the mappings you can use to interact with the window:

* UP, TAB, CTRL+K: move up in the list.
* DOWN, CTRL+J: move down in the list.
* RETURN, CTRL+O, CTRL+E: open the selected file.
* ESC, CTRL+C: close the list.
* CTRL+D: delete the selected file (it won't show up anymore in the list until
you'll edit that file again).


OzzyIndex

Add recursively to the database all files under the current directory that have
any of the extensions you give as argument.

  e.g. OzzyIndex py,md,cpp


OzzyReset 

Remove all the entries from the database.
